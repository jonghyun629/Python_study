# 🔹 1. **For Loops**

Used when you want to **repeat a block of code for each item in a sequence** (list, tuple, string, range, etc.).

### Basic Example:

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)

```

👉 Output:

```
apple
banana
cherry

```

### Using `range()`

`range(start, stop, step)` generates numbers.

```python
for i in range(5):      # 0 → 4
    print(i)

for i in range(2, 10, 2):   # 2, 4, 6, 8
    print(i)

```

---

# 🔹 2. **While Loops**

Used when you want to **repeat until a condition is no longer true**.

### Example:

```python
count = 0

while count < 5:
    print("Count is:", count)
    count += 1

```

👉 Output:

```
Count is: 0
Count is: 1
Count is: 2
Count is: 3
Count is: 4

```

⚠️ Be careful: If the condition never becomes `False`, it’s an **infinite loop**.

# 🔹 3. Loop Control Statements

- **`break`** → stop the loop completely
- **`continue`** → skip the current iteration, go to the next

```python
for i in range(5):
    if i == 3:
        break       # stop loop when i=3
    print(i)

```

👉 Output: `0 1 2`

```python
for i in range(5):
    if i == 3:
        continue    # skip i=3
    print(i)

```

👉 Output: `0 1 2 4`

---

# 🔹 4. Combining with `else`

Loops can have an **`else` block** that runs if the loop finishes normally (not stopped by `break`).

```python
for i in range(3):
    print(i)
else:
    print("Loop finished!")

```

---

# 🔹 Quick Summary

- **For loop** → repeat for each item in a sequence.
- **While loop** → repeat while a condition is true.
- **break** → exit loop early.
- **continue** → skip current step.
- **else** → runs if loop wasn’t broken.

# 🔹 Practice 📝

1. Use a **for loop** to print numbers from 1 → 10.
2. Use a **while loop** to count down from 5 → 1.
3. Loop through a word (like `"Python"`) and print each letter.
4. Use a loop to find the first number divisible by 7 between 1 and 20.
