# 🔹 1. Indexing

- Python uses **zero-based indexing**: first item = index `0`.
- Works on lists, tuples, strings.

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(fruits[0])   # apple
print(fruits[1])   # banana
print(fruits[-1])  # cherry (negative index = count from end)

```

👉 Negative indexing is handy:

- `1` = last item
- `2` = second-to-last, etc.

---

# 🔹 2. Slicing

- Use `[start:end]` to get part of a sequence.
- `start` = inclusive, `end` = exclusive.
- You can also use `[start:end:step]`.

```python
numbers = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

print(numbers[1:4])    # [1, 2, 3]  (index 1 → 3)
print(numbers[:3])     # [0, 1, 2]  (from start → 2)
print(numbers[3:])     # [3, 4, 5]  (from 3 → end)
print(numbers[::2])    # [0, 2, 4]  (every 2nd element)
print(numbers[::-1])   # [5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0] (reverse list)

```

👉 Works for **strings** too:

```python
word = "Python"
print(word[0:3])   # Pyt
print(word[::-1])  # nohtyP (reversed string)

```

# 🔹 3. Looping Through Data

You can **iterate** over sequences (lists, tuples, strings, etc.).

### (A) For Loop

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)

```

### (B) Loop with Index (using `range(len(...))`)

```python
for i in range(len(fruits)):
    print(i, fruits[i])

```

### (C) While Loop

```python
i = 0
while i < len(fruits):
    print(fruits[i])
    i += 1

```

# 🔹 Quick Summary

- **Indexing** → pick one item: `list[2]`
- **Slicing** → pick a sublist: `list[1:4]`
- **Looping** → go through all items: `for item in list:`

---

# 🔹 Practice 📝

1. Make a list of 5 numbers.
    - Print the **first** and **last** number using indexing.
2. Slice out the middle 3 numbers.
3. Loop through the list and print each number doubled.
4. Take a string `"HelloWorld"` → print only `"Hello"`.
5. Reverse the string using slicing.
