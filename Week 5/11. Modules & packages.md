# 🔹 1. What is a Module?

- A **module** is just a **Python file (`.py`)** that contains functions, classes, or variables you want to reuse.
- Think of it as a **toolbox**.

### Example: mymath.py

```python
# mymath.py
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

def square(x):
    return x * x

```

Now in another file:

```python
import mymath

print(mymath.add(3, 4))     # 7
print(mymath.square(5))     # 25

```

👉 `mymath` is a **module**.

# 🔹 2. Built-in Modules

Python already comes with many modules.

Examples: `math`, `random`, `datetime`.

```python
import math
print(math.sqrt(16))    # 4.0
print(math.pi)          # 3.14159

```

```python
import random
print(random.randint(1, 10))  # random number 1–10

```

---

# 🔹 3. Import Variations

```python
import math
print(math.sqrt(25))

from math import sqrt, pi
print(sqrt(25), pi)     # directly use

import math as m
print(m.sqrt(25))       # alias

```

---

# 🔹 4. What is a Package?

- A **package** is a **collection of modules** in a folder.
- The folder usually contains an `__init__.py` file (can be empty) to tell Python it’s a package.
- Example folder structure:

```
mypackage/
    __init__.py
    math_tools.py
    string_tools.py

```

### Usage:

```python
from mypackage import math_tools
print(math_tools.add(2, 3))

```

---

# 🔹 5. Installing External Packages

- You can install third-party packages using **pip**:

```bash
pip install requests

```

- Example:

```python
import requests

response = requests.get("https://api.github.com")
print(response.status_code)   # 200

```

---

# 🔹 Quick Summary

- **Module** = single `.py` file with code you can reuse.
- **Package** = folder with multiple modules.
- **Built-in modules** (like `math`, `random`) are ready to use.
- **External packages** are installed via `pip`.

---

# 🔹 Practice 📝

1. Create a file `greet.py` with a function `say_hello(name)` that prints `"Hello, {name}"`.
2. Import it into another Python file and call it.
3. Use the built-in `random` module to simulate rolling a dice (1–6).
