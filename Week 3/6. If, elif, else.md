# 🔹 1. `if` Statement

Runs a block of code **only if** the condition is `True`.

```python
x = 10

if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")

```

👉 Output: `x is greater than 5`

---

# 🔹 2. `if / else`

The `else` block runs if the `if` condition is **False**.

```python
age = 15

if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult")
else:
    print("You are a minor")

```

👉 Output: `You are a minor`

---

# 🔹 3. `if / elif / else`

`elif` (short for *else if*) checks another condition if the first is `False`.

```python
score = 85

if score >= 90:
    print("Grade: A")
elif score >= 80:
    print("Grade: B")
elif score >= 70:
    print("Grade: C")
else:
    print("Grade: F")

```

👉 Output: `Grade: B`

---

# 🔹 4. Nested `if`

You can put an `if` inside another `if`.

```python
age = 20
has_id = True

if age >= 18:
    if has_id:
        print("You can enter.")
    else:
        print("You need an ID.")
else:
    print("You are too young.")

```

---

# 🔹 5. Short `if` (Ternary Operator)

You can write it in one line:

```python
x = 5
result = "Even" if x % 2 == 0 else "Odd"
print(result)   # Odd

```

---

# 🔹 Quick Summary

- **`if`** → checks first condition.
- **`elif`** → extra conditions.
- **`else`** → default, if nothing above is true.

---

# 🔹 Practice 📝

1. Ask the user for a number → print if it’s **positive, negative, or zero**.
2. Ask for age → print `"Child"`, `"Teen"`, `"Adult"`.
3. Write a grading program:
    - `90+` → A
    - `80+` → B
    - `70+` → C
    - else → F
