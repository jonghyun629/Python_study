# 🔹 What is a Nested Loop?

A **nested loop** is a loop inside another loop.

- The **outer loop** runs first.
- For **each iteration** of the outer loop, the **inner loop** runs completely.

---

# 🔹 Example 1: Nested `for` loop

```python
for i in range(3):          # outer loop
    for j in range(2):      # inner loop
        print(f"i={i}, j={j}")

```

👉 Output:

```
i=0, j=0
i=0, j=1
i=1, j=0
i=1, j=1
i=2, j=0
i=2, j=1

```

# 🔹 Example 2: Printing a Pattern

```python
for i in range(1, 4):        # rows
    for j in range(1, i+1):  # columns
        print("*", end=" ")
    print()   # new line after inner loop

```

👉 Output:

```
*
* *
* * *

```

---

# 🔹 Example 3: Nested `while` loop

```python
i = 1
while i <= 3:
    j = 1
    while j <= 2:
        print(f"i={i}, j={j}")
        j += 1
    i += 1

```

---

# 🔹 Example 4: Looping through a 2D List

```python
matrix = [[1, 2, 3],
          [4, 5, 6],
          [7, 8, 9]]

for row in matrix:
    for num in row:
        print(num, end=" ")
    print()

```

👉 Output:

```
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9

```

# 🔹 Quick Summary

- A **nested loop** = loop inside another loop.
- Commonly used for **patterns, grids, 2D lists, matrices, tables**.
- Inner loop runs fully for **each** outer loop iteration.

---

# 🔹 Practice 📝

1. Use nested loops to print this multiplication table (1–3):

```
1 x 1 = 1
1 x 2 = 2
...
3 x 3 = 9

```

1. Print a square of `#` with size 4×4.
2. Print all pairs of numbers from 1 to 3.
