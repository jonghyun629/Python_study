# 🔹 1. TXT Files

### Writing to a text file

```python
# write mode "w" (overwrites), append mode "a" (adds), read "r"
with open("example.txt", "w") as f:
    f.write("Hello, World!\n")
    f.write("This is a text file.")

```

### Reading a text file

```python
with open("example.txt", "r") as f:
    content = f.read()
print(content)

```

👉 You can also use:

- `f.readline()` → read one line
- `f.readlines()` → read all lines into a list

# 🔹 2. CSV Files (Comma-Separated Values)

Used for **tables/spreadsheets**.

### Writing CSV

```python
import csv

with open("data.csv", "w", newline="") as f:
    writer = csv.writer(f)
    writer.writerow(["Name", "Age"])
    writer.writerow(["Alice", 25])
    writer.writerow(["Bob", 30])

```

👉 Creates:

```
Name,Age
Alice,25
Bob,30

```

### Reading CSV

```python
import csv

with open("data.csv", "r") as f:
    reader = csv.reader(f)
    for row in reader:
        print(row)

```

👉 Output:

```
['Name', 'Age']
['Alice', '25']
['Bob', '30']

```

# 🔹 3. JSON Files (JavaScript Object Notation)

Used for **structured data** (like dictionaries). Common in APIs.

### Writing JSON

```python
import json

data = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25, "hobbies": ["reading", "cycling"]}

with open("data.json", "w") as f:
    json.dump(data, f)

```

### Reading JSON

```python
import json

with open("data.json", "r") as f:
    data = json.load(f)

print(data)
print(data["name"])   # Alice

```

---

# 🔹 Quick Summary

- **TXT** → plain text, use `open()`.
- **CSV** → tables/spreadsheets, use `csv` module.
- **JSON** → structured data (dicts/lists), use `json` module.

# 🔹 Practice 📝

1. Write a program that saves 3 lines of text into `notes.txt`, then reads it back.
2. Create a `students.csv` with names & grades, then read and print it.
3. Save a dictionary `{"city": "Seoul", "temp": 27}` into `weather.json`, then load and print it.
